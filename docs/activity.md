# Development Activity Log

## Project Setup Phase - Competition Entry

### Initial Setup (Phase 1) ‚úÖ

**Date**: Current Development Session  
**Goal**: Create a comprehensive Student Profile & Goal Tracking System for educational competition

#### Completed Tasks:

1. **Project Structure Creation** ‚úÖ
   - Created complete directory structure (src/, docs/, tasks/, public/)
   - Organized backend (Express.js) and frontend (React) separation
   - Set up database schema directory with migrations

2. **Package Configuration** ‚úÖ
   - Root package.json with concurrently for development workflow
   - Backend package.json with Express.js, security middleware, database drivers
   - Frontend package.json with React 18, Bootstrap 5, routing, HTTP client
   - All dependencies installed successfully

3. **Database Schema Design** ‚úÖ
   - **MariaDB** with comprehensive relational schema
   - **17 core tables** covering users, profiles, goals, skills, interests, surveys, files
   - **BLOB storage** for resume files (up to 10MB per requirements)
   - **Demo data seeding** with teacher/student/admin accounts
   - **Indexes and constraints** for performance and data integrity

4. **Backend API Foundation** ‚úÖ
   - **Express.js server** with security middleware (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting)
   - **Session-based authentication** with bcrypt password hashing
   - **Role-based authorization** middleware (teacher/student/admin)
   - **Input validation** and sanitization for security
   - **Structured logging** with Winston
   - **Health check endpoints** for monitoring
   - **RESTful API routes** (auth, users, students, surveys, files, analytics, export)

5. **Frontend React Application** ‚úÖ
   - **React 18** with JavaScript (simplicity over TypeScript per requirements)
   - **Bootstrap 5** for responsive UI styling
   - **React Router** for navigation and protected routes
   - **Context API** for authentication state management
   - **Axios** for API communication with credentials
   - **Role-based UI** components and navigation

6. **Security Implementation** ‚úÖ
   - **OWASP compliance** with security headers, input validation, rate limiting
   - **Authentication/Authorization** with sessions and role checks
   - **File upload security** with type validation and size limits
   - **CSRF protection** and XSS prevention
   - **SQL injection prevention** with parameterized queries

7. **Development Environment** ‚úÖ
   - **Docker Compose** for MariaDB and Redis services
   - **Development scripts** for concurrent frontend/backend execution
   - **Environment configuration** with .env files
   - **Git setup** with comprehensive .gitignore

#### Key Files Created:

**Backend Core:**
- `src/backend/server.js` - Main Express application
- `src/backend/config/database.js` - MariaDB connection management
- `src/backend/middleware/auth.js` - Authentication & authorization
- `src/backend/middleware/security.js` - Security middleware & validation
- `src/backend/routes/` - Complete API route structure

**Frontend Core:**
- `src/frontend/src/App.js` - Main React application with routing
- `src/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.js` - Authentication management
- `src/frontend/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/frontend/src/pages/` - Page components for all routes

**Database:**
- `src/database/schemas/01_create_database.sql` - Core tables (users, profiles, goals, skills)
- `src/database/schemas/02_survey_and_files.sql` - Survey system & file management
- `src/database/schemas/03_seed_data.sql` - Demo data with test accounts

**Configuration:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Complete development environment
- `package.json` files with all required dependencies
- `README.md` - Comprehensive setup and usage documentation

#### Demo Accounts Available:
- **Teacher**: teacher@demo.com / teacher123
- **Student**: student1@demo.com / student123
- **Admin**: admin@demo.com / admin123

#### Architecture Decisions:

1. **Monolithic over Microservices** - Following CLAUDE.md simplicity principle
2. **Session-based Auth** - Simpler than JWT for this scope
3. **Database BLOB Storage** - Atomic transactions, simplified backup
4. **Raw SQL Queries** - Avoiding ORM complexity initially
5. **Bootstrap over Custom CSS** - Faster development, proven responsive design

#### Security Measures Implemented:

- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Session management with secure cookies
- Rate limiting (100 requests/15min general, 5/15min auth)
- Input validation and sanitization
- File upload restrictions (10MB, PDF/DOCX only)
- CORS configuration for frontend communication
- Security headers with Helmet.js

#### Performance Considerations:

- Database indexing on frequently queried columns
- Connection pooling for MariaDB
- File streaming for downloads
- Frontend code splitting ready
- CDN-ready static asset serving

### Next Steps (Phase 2):

1. **Student Profile CRUD Implementation**
   - Complete profile creation/editing forms
   - Goals, skills, and interests management
   - Profile completion tracking

2. **File Upload & Resume Parsing**
   - Implement Multer file upload with validation
   - PDF/DOCX text extraction with pdf-parse/mammoth
   - Custom parsing logic for skills/experience extraction

3. **Survey System**
   - Survey builder with multiple question types
   - Survey assignment and response collection
   - Template management for teachers

4. **Data Visualization Dashboard**
   - Recharts integration for analytics
   - Class-wide statistics and individual summaries
   - Interactive charts and progress tracking

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Search and filtering system
   - Data export (CSV/JSON/PDF)
   - Email notifications
   - Advanced analytics
